#### ***In this updated version, I've implemented more assertive fine-tuning of LightGBM (LGBM). Through this meticulous refinement of parameters, the model demonstrates enhanced performance in both cross-validation (CV) assessments and leaderboard (LB) standings compared to its previous iteration. Notably, the CV score surpasses that of any publicly available benchmarks, showcasing its superior efficacy. However, it's worth noting that while the CV score excels, the LB score, albeit marginally lower, still places it competitively within the leaderboard rankings.***
